# passman: A deterministic password generator and manager

Passman generates unique passwords deterministically from a single master
password. A hash of the master password is stored on disk to prevent
accidentally generating a password from a mistyped master password.


## Warning

**This is still a work in progress.** Feel free to try it out, but don't count
on its security just yet.
